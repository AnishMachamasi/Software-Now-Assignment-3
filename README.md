# üéì HIT137 Group Assignment 3 ‚Äì Image Editor & 2D Scrolling Shooter Game

Welcome to our repository for **Group Assignment 3** for the **HIT137 ‚Äì Foundations of Computer Science** course at **Charles Darwin University**.

This project is divided into two distinct parts:

- üñºÔ∏è A **Desktop Image Editing Application** using **Tkinter** and **OpenCV**
- üéÆ A **Scrolling Shooter 2D Game** using **Pygame**

---

## üìù Project Overview

This project demonstrates key programming concepts learned in HIT137, including object-oriented programming, graphical user interface design, and basic game development. It consists of two main deliverables: an image editor application that supports loading, cropping, resizing, and saving images, and a scrolling shooter 2D game featuring player control, enemies, collectibles, and multiple levels.
